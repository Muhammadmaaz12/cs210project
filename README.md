# Spotify Sport Playlist Analysis

## Motivation

As an avid music listener, I have always enjoyed the experience of discovering and enjoying different genres of music, especially during my sports activities. This project stems from a personal interest in delving into the features of songs that make them suitable for a sporty playlist. Through the analysis, I aim to gain insights into the characteristics of the songs I often listen to during sports sessions.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from my sport playlist on Spotify. To obtain the data in CSV format, I utilized www.chosic.com, a tool we have previously employed in other assignments. The dataset encompasses various features of each song, providing a comprehensive view of the musical elements in my sports playlist.

## Data Analysis

### Preprocessing
- The initial phase involved preprocessing the data, which included handling null values, dropping unnecessary columns, and understanding the data format.
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Applied various EDA techniques and visualization methods.As an example, classified songs into low, medium, and high energy categories based on energy values.

### Machine Learning Model (Random Forest Classifier)
- Utilized a Random Forest Classifier to predict the energy category of songs.
- Achieved an accuracy of 1.00, indicating the model's high performance.

## Findings

The analysis yielded several interesting findings:

1. **Energetic Songs:** A significant portion of the songs in the sports playlist are categorized as high-energy, aligning well with the playlist's intended purpose.

2. **Popularity:** Most of the songs are popular, suggesting a preference for well-received tracks.

3. **Duration:** The majority of songs are relatively short in duration, possibly reflecting the preference for quick-paced, dynamic tracks during sports activities.

4. **Genre Preferences:** Hip-hop emerged as the predominant genre, indicating a strong inclination towards this genre during sports sessions.

5. **Favorite Artist:** Travis Scott emerged as the favorite artist, with a notable presence in the playlist.

6. **Machine Learning Insights:** The Random Forest Classifier emphasized the importance of features such as Energy and Loudness in predicting the energy category of songs.

## Limitations

As a newcomer to data science, I encountered challenges in determining where to start and what steps to take with the dataset. The learning process involved overcoming obstacles and finding effective approaches to analyze the data effectively.

## Future Work

Looking ahead, there are exciting possibilities for future work:

- Expanding Analysis: Consider analyzing other playlists to gain a comprehensive understanding of musical preferences.
  
- Learning Machine Learning: Delve deeper into machine learning techniques to apply more advanced models and enhance analytical capabilities.
